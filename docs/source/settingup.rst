Setting Up Scrapista
====================

Installing Scrapista 
---------------------
There are barely any requirements for getting started with scrapista!

- You need to have 2.7 or a higher version of Python installed in your computer. You can check this by typing ```python --version``` command in the terminal you use.

After that you can directly install scrapista on your Python environment by typing ```python -m install scrapista``` or ```pip install scrapista``` command. 

If you are on a **Linux** device,

You might want to try ```python3 -m install scrapista``` or ```pip3 install scrapista``` commands instead of the prior ones.
